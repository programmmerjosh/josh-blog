My own blog website

This project started as a free Bootstrap theme that looked good. I customized it to my liking plus added content.

I then adapted the website into a React App (for fun and for a decent page-load speed) - You'll reach the React App when you visit https://think-write-grow.com.

Latest news: I'm recreating the website as a VueJS app, implementing some of the latest skills I've learned. Exciting! I'll be publishing the latest version soonish.

Well, this is my blog site. It's far from finished, but hope you like it.
