                  <p id="section-description">
                    I'd like to share some very powerful and revealing
                    resources I've accumulated on health and the effects of
                    thought on the body. Each of the sources here, you'll
                    probably find to be unpopular in the media today. The
                    politicians and news journalists around the world have been
                    consistently warning us that we are in danger and face a
                    deadly virus called Covid-19. We've been told to be afraid,
                    forced to isolate, distance ourselves from our friends and
                    family members. A hug or even a handshake from someone
                    outside of your "bubble" has been considered no longer safe.
                    We've been told to mask our faces (our identities, our
                    emotions) when entering an essential store/business. We've
                    been forced to close our "non-essential" businesses (for
                    many of us, our primary sources of income) until who knows
                    when. In the UK and probably many other parts of the world,
                    our sporting facilities and our local gyms (the places most
                    of us use to exercise - strengthen our body's immune
                    systems, engage with like-minded individuals, relieve
                    stress) have, at the time of this writing, been forcibly
                    closed as well. In some countries, a curfew had also been
                    enforced for a period of time. We've been alone and locked
                    up in our own homes as if we were all put on house arrest
                    for someone else’s crime. It prompts one to ask, "is there
                    still such a thing as a free country?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, I'd like to share a few encouraging things here
                    despite what's going on around the world. I'd like to
                    encourage you not to fear and not to lose hope. Do not be
                    dismayed by the message of the media and the fear headlines
                    we've been bombarded with. I have strong reason to believe
                    that this virus is not as bad as the media may portray it to
                    be. And I personally am not going to cower in fear nor treat
                    any person I come into contact with as if they're a
                    biohazard. I hope you join me. I hope this message can
                    encourage you and that the resources here can help you
                    understand that fear and worry, are not healthy for you and
                    certainly not helpful in any way. Virus or no virus, let's
                    not give in to fear. Let's open up our minds to positivity
                    and hopefulness so we can get through this troubling time
                    and whatever else may come our way.

                            Disease and health, like circumstances, are rooted
                            in thought. Sickly thoughts will express themselves
                            through a sickly body. Thoughts of fear have been
                            known to kill a man as speedily as a bullet, and
                            they are continually killing thousands of people
                            just as surely though less rapidly. The people who
                            live in fear of disease are the people who get it.
                            Anxiety quickly demoralizes the whole body, and lays
                            it open to the entrance of disease; while

                            This fear may be traced to both physical and social
                            heredity. It is closely associated, as to its
                            origin, with the causes of fear of Old Age and the
                            fear of Death, because it leads one closely to the
                            border of "terrible worlds" of which man knows not,
                            but concerning which he has been taught some
                            discomforting stories. The opinion is somewhat
                            general, also, that certain unethical people engaged
                            in the business of "selling health" have had not a
                            little to do with keeping alive the fear of ill
                            health.

                            terrible pictures which have been planted in his
                            mind of what may happen if death should overtake
                            him. He also fears it because of the economic toll

                            A reputable physician estimated that 75% of all
                            people who visit physicians for professional service
                            are suffering with hypochondria (imaginary illness).
                            It has been shown most convincingly that the fear of
                            disease, even where there is not the slightest cause
                            for fear, often produces the physical symptoms of
                            the disease feared.

                            years ago that Colliers' Weekly Magazine conducted a

                            During the "flu" epidemic which broke out during the
                            world war, the mayor of New York City took drastic
                            steps to check the damage which people were doing
                            themselves through their inherent fear of ill
                            health. He called in the newspaper men and said to
                            them, "Gentlemen, I feel it necessary to ask you not
                            to publish any scare headlines concerning the 'flu'
                            epidemic. Unless you cooperate with me, we will have
                            a situation which we cannot control." The newspapers
                            quit publishing stories about the "flu," and within
                            one month the epidemic had been successfully
                            checked.

                            Through a series of experiments conducted some years
                            ago, it was proved that people may be made ill by
                            suggestion. We conducted this experiment by causing
                            three acquaintances to visit the "victims," each of
                            whom asked the question, "What ails you? You look
                            terribly ill." The first questioner usually provoked
                            a grin, and a nonchalant "Oh, nothing, I'm alright,"
                            from the victim. The second questioner usually was
                            answered with the statement, "I don't know exactly,
                            but I do feel badly." The third questioner was
                            usually met with the frank admission that the victim
                            was actually feeling ill.

                            will make him uncomfortable, but do not carry the
                            experiment too far. There is a certain religious
                            sect whose members take vengeance upon their enemies
                            by the "hexing" method. They call it "placing a
                            spell" on the victim.

                            There is overwhelming evidence that disease

                            impulse. Such an impulse may be passed from one mind
                            to another, by suggestion, or created by an
                            individual in his own mind.

                            This is a well expressed perspective on the
                            Christian way to deal with worry appropriately. It
                            may be rarely practiced today and definitely not
                            something easy to do. However, most of us will agree
                            that this rings true and reassures one why we
                            shouldn't be spending any time worrying about things
                            we largely cannot control.

                            Historically, medicine in modern society has defined its mission in terms of curing disease —the medical disorder—while overlooking 
                            illness —the patient's experience of disease. Patients, by going along with this view of their problem, join a quiet conspiracy to ignore 
                            how they are reacting emotionally to their medical problems—or to dismiss those reactions as irrelevant to the course of the problem 
                            itself. That attitude is reinforced by a medical model that dismisses entirely the idea that mind influences body in any consequential way. 
                            Yet there is an equally unproductive ideology in the other direction: the notion that people can cure themselves of even the most

                             has been to create widespread confusion and misunderstanding about the extent to which illness can be 
                            affected by the mind, and, perhaps worse, sometimes to make people feel guilty for having a disease, as though it were a sign of some moral

                             are still skeptical that emotions matter clinically. One reason is that while many studies have found stress and 
                            negative emotions to weaken the effectiveness of various immune cells, it is not always clear that the range of these changes is great enough 
                            to make a medical difference. Even so, 
                            <strong>
                            an increasing number of physicians acknowledge the place of emotions in medicine.</strong>

                            panicked that day and does not want to go through with it, I cancel the surgery." Nezhat explains, "Every surgeon knows that people who are 
                            extremely scared do terribly in surgery. They bleed too much, they have more infections and complications. They have a harder time recovering.

                            categories of disease). This order of magnitude makes distressing emotions as toxic a risk factor as, say, smoking or high cholesterol are for 
                            heart disease—in other words, a major threat to health. 
                            To be sure, this is a broad statistical link, and by no means indicates that everyone who has such chronic feelings will thus more easily 
                            fall prey to a disease. But the evidence for a potent role for emotion in disease is far more extensive than this one study of studies indicates.

                            In one of the most scientifically compelling studies, Sheldon Cohen, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon University, working with scientists 
                            at a specialized colds research unit in Sheffield, England, carefully assessed how much stress people were feeling in their lives, and then 
                            systematically exposed them to a cold virus. Not everyone so exposed actually comes down with a cold; a robust immune system can—and 
                            constantly does—resist the cold virus. Cohen found that the more stress in their lives, the more likely people were to catch cold. Among 
                            those with little stress, 27 percent came down with a cold after being exposed to the virus; among those with the most stressful lives, 47 
                            percent got the cold—direct evidence that 
                            <strong>
                            stress itself weakens the immune system.</strong> (While this may be one of those scientific results that 
                            confirms what everyone has observed or suspected all along, it is considered a landmark finding because of its scientific

                            Like its near cousin optimism, hope has healing power. People who have a great deal 
                            of hopefulness are, understandably, better able to bear up under trying circumstances, 
                            including medical difficulties. In a study of people paralysed from spinal injuries, those 
                            who had more hope were able to gain greater levels of physical mobility compared to 
                            other patients with similar degrees of injury, but who felt less hopeful. Hope is 
                            especially telling in paralysis from spinal injury, since this medical tragedy typically 
                            involves a man who is paralysed in his twenties by an accident and will remain so for 
                            the rest of his life. How he reacts emotionally will have broad consequences for the degree 
                            to which he will make the efforts that might bring him greater physical and social functioning.
                            Just why an optimistic or pessimistic outlook should have health consequences is open to any of 
                            several explanations.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            One theory proposes that pessimism leads to depression, which in turn 
                            interferes with the resistance of the immune system to tumors and infection—an unproven speculation 
                            at present. Or it may be that pessimists neglect themselves—some studies have found that pessimists 
                            smoke and drink more, and exercise less, than optimists, and are generally much more careless about 
                            their health habits. Or it may one day turn out that the

                            …emotional care is an opportunity too often lost in the way medicine is practiced today; it is a blind 
                            spot for medicine. Despite mounting data on the medical usefulness of attending to emotional needs, as 
                            well as supporting evidence for connections between the brain's emotional center and the immune system, 
                            many physicians remain skeptical that their patients' emotions matter clinically, dismissing the

                            On the other hand, there may be a business advantage to humane medicine: treating emotional distress in patients, 
                            early evidence suggests, can save money—especially to the extent that it prevents or delays the onset of sickness, 
                            or helps patients heal more quickly. In a study of elderly patients with hip fracture at Mt. Sinai School of
