                  <p id="section-description">
                    I'd like to share some very powerful and revealing resources 
                    I've accumulated on health and the effects of thought (and 
                    emotion) on the body. Each of the sources here, you'll 
                    probably find to be unpopular/undiscovered in mainstream 
                    media today. Our politicians and news journalists all around 
                    the world have been consistently warning us that we are in 
                    danger and are under threat by a deadly virus called Covid-19. 
                    We've been told to be afraid, forced to isolate (stay home), 
                    distance ourselves from our friends and family members. In 
                    some parts of the world (Australia, Canada), internment camps 
                    have even been built as a potential “measure of containment.” 
                    A hug or even a handshake from someone outside of your 
                    "bubble" has (or at least for a lengthy period of time, had) 
                    been considered no longer safe. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In many parts of the world, a face mask (or face covering of 
                    any sort) was and still is, in some parts, considered 
                    mandatory when inside any store or place of business. Just 
                    the fact that ANY face-covering will suffice, proves that 
                    there was little to zero scrutiny of any scientific data on 
                    mask protection against respiratory viruses. Would you find 
                    any sane virologist using a bandana for protection when 
                    dealing with any kind of virus? I don’t think so. Studies 
                    have in fact shown that a surgical mask (the thing most 
                    people use to comply with the rules) will prohibit particles 
                    as small as 0.3 microns & larger; and respiratory viral 
                    particles (like the flu and Covid-19) are around 0.1 micros 
                    in size. So don’t even waste your time (or your fresh air) 
                    wearing one. See this 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0tmalcJ6WRA">link 
                      to a presentation of these studies</a>. But, “mask your 
                    faces” they say. “You’ll protect everyone around you, just 
                    in case you have it”. This implying the theory of asymptomatic 
                    transmission, which was never really a thing before Covid-19 
                    came along. And to this day, still doesn’t hold up under any 
                    reliable scientific data. See this 
                    <a target="_blank" 
                    href="https://odysee.com/@drsambailey:c/Odysee-Exclusive---Covid-19-Asymptomatic-Transmission-Small-Video-:e">link 
                    to a video explaining the weak theory of asymptomatic transmission</a>.

                    Gyms were closed for a period of time - the place many people 
                    use for exercise purposes, to combat health issues and 
                    strengthen one’s immune system. Where’s the logic in shutting 
                    these facilities down? A curfew had been implemented for a 
                    time, and may in fact still be implemented in some parts of 
                    the world. Is the virus somehow more prevalent after 10pm? 
                    Someone please explain this to me. And of course lockdowns 
                    are still not ruled out as a course of action. No-one has 
                    been able to show that lockdowns work in terms of “flattening 
                    the curve.” But they certainly have proven to increase 
                    suicide rates, domestic abuse, loneliness, depression, and 
                    the list goes on. Do I even need to mention the devastation 
                    of small businesses or the rise in social welfare dependance?

                    It’s difficult to not go on about the horrendous measures 
                    taken by our leaders, especially after how much we’ve already 
                    learned about this respiratory virus. This is also not to 
                    say that we don’t acknowledge that people have died. But we’re 
                    talking about a very small percentage of the population here 
                    (statistically). When you take into account the context of 
                    how many people actually die every year (another thing rarely, 
                    if ever, covered by mainstream media), Covid-19 evidently 
                    becomes trivial. Full-recovery stats are impressively high 
                    but unfortunately not news-worthy. Flu (respiratory virus) 
                    related deaths have been happening all around the world long 
                    before Covid-19 showed up and are certainly not uncommon. 
                    Quite honestly, by looking at the scientific data we’ve 
                    collected over the past year, if you’re not suffering from 
                    diabetes, obesity, heart disease or any other moderate-to-severe 
                    underlying health condition (or have a weakened immune 
                    system due to old-age, for example), you really have no reason 
                    to fear this thing. And if you do have one of these conditions 
                    mentioned, then in your case, yes, perhaps you should be more 
                    cautious. But even more than that, in my unprofessional 
                    opinion, you should begin to make an effort to take better 
                    care of your health by means of eating more healthily and 
                    incorporating exercise into your daily lifestyle. You may 
                    want to seek professional help on the subject, if necessary.

                    Nevertheless, I’d like to share a few encouraging things with 
                    you despite what's going on around the world. I'd like to 
                    encourage you not to fear and not to lose hope. Do not be 
                    dismayed by the message of the media and the fear headlines 
                    we've been bombarded with. I have strong reason to believe 
                    that this virus is not as bad as the media may portray it 
                    to be. And I personally am not going to cower in fear nor 
                    treat any person I come into contact with as if they're a 
                    potential biohazard. I hope you join me. By reading through 
                    the resources I’m about to share with you, you will begin 
                    to see that the media (whether intentionally or not) are in 
                    fact exacerbating this problem. I hope this message can 
                    encourage you and that the resources here can help you 
                    understand that fear and worry, are not healthy for you 
                    and certainly not helpful in any way. Virus or not, let's 
                    not give in to fear. Let's open up our minds to positivity 
                    and hopefulness so we can get through this 
                    troubling/frustrating/annoying time and even get through 
                    whatever else may come our way.

                            This is a well expressed perspective on the
                            Christian way to deal with worry appropriately. It
                            may be rarely practiced today and definitely not
                            something easy to do. However, most of us will agree
                            that this rings true and reassures one why we
                            shouldn't be spending any time worrying about things
                            we largely cannot control.

                            Historically, medicine in modern society has defined its mission in terms of curing disease —the medical disorder—while overlooking 
                            illness —the patient's experience of disease. Patients, by going along with this view of their problem, join a quiet conspiracy to ignore 
                            how they are reacting emotionally to their medical problems—or to dismiss those reactions as irrelevant to the course of the problem 
                            itself. That attitude is reinforced by a medical model that dismisses entirely the idea that mind influences body in any consequential way. 
                            Yet there is an equally unproductive ideology in the other direction: the notion that people can cure themselves of even the most

                             has been to create widespread confusion and misunderstanding about the extent to which illness can be 
                            affected by the mind, and, perhaps worse, sometimes to make people feel guilty for having a disease, as though it were a sign of some moral

                             are still skeptical that emotions matter clinically. One reason is that while many studies have found stress and 
                            negative emotions to weaken the effectiveness of various immune cells, it is not always clear that the range of these changes is great enough 
                            to make a medical difference. Even so, 
                            <strong>
                            an increasing number of physicians acknowledge the place of emotions in medicine.</strong>

                            panicked that day and does not want to go through with it, I cancel the surgery." Nezhat explains, "Every surgeon knows that people who are 
                            extremely scared do terribly in surgery. They bleed too much, they have more infections and complications. They have a harder time recovering.

                            categories of disease). This order of magnitude makes distressing emotions as toxic a risk factor as, say, smoking or high cholesterol are for 
                            heart disease—in other words, a major threat to health. 
                            To be sure, this is a broad statistical link, and by no means indicates that everyone who has such chronic feelings will thus more easily 
                            fall prey to a disease. But the evidence for a potent role for emotion in disease is far more extensive than this one study of studies indicates.

                            In one of the most scientifically compelling studies, Sheldon Cohen, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon University, working with scientists 
                            at a specialized colds research unit in Sheffield, England, carefully assessed how much stress people were feeling in their lives, and then 
                            systematically exposed them to a cold virus. Not everyone so exposed actually comes down with a cold; a robust immune system can—and 
                            constantly does—resist the cold virus. Cohen found that the more stress in their lives, the more likely people were to catch cold. Among 
                            those with little stress, 27 percent came down with a cold after being exposed to the virus; among those with the most stressful lives, 47 
                            percent got the cold—direct evidence that 
                            <strong>
                            stress itself weakens the immune system.</strong> (While this may be one of those scientific results that

                            Like its near cousin optimism, hope has healing power. People who have a great deal 
                            of hopefulness are, understandably, better able to bear up under trying circumstances, 
                            including medical difficulties. In a study of people paralysed from spinal injuries, those 
                            who had more hope were able to gain greater levels of physical mobility compared to 
                            other patients with similar degrees of injury, but who felt less hopeful. Hope is 
                            especially telling in paralysis from spinal injury, since this medical tragedy typically 
                            involves a man who is paralysed in his twenties by an accident and will remain so for 
                            the rest of his life. How he reacts emotionally will have broad consequences for the degree 
                            to which he will make the efforts that might bring him greater physical and social functioning.
                            Just why an optimistic or pessimistic outlook should have health consequences is open to any of 
                            several explanations.

                            One theory proposes that pessimism leads to depression, which in turn 
                            interferes with the resistance of the immune system to tumors and infection—an unproven speculation 
                            at present. Or it may be that pessimists neglect themselves—some studies have found that pessimists 
                            smoke and drink more, and exercise less, than optimists, and are generally much more careless about 
                            their health habits. Or it may one day turn out that the

                            On the other hand, there may be a business advantage to humane medicine: treating emotional distress in patients, 
                            early evidence suggests, can save money—especially to the extent that it prevents or delays the onset of sickness, 
                            or helps patients heal more quickly. In a study of elderly patients with hip fracture at Mt. Sinai School of

                          connecting it to the onset of sickness and course of 
                          recovery.”

                        The media, books, articles, stories, videos, 
                        music etc. one consumes, whether we want to acknowledge this 
                        or not, plays a powerfully influential role in one’s mind. And 
                        thus, surely playing a key role in the influence of one’s 
                        emotions. For a moment, think about how debilitating, discouraging, 
                        scary and depressing our mainstream news has become. Also, 
                        consider the frequency of your own consumption of this type of 
                        news. Do you watch/read the news everyday? What impact do you 
                        think this would have on your own mind and on your own thinking 
                        patterns? Would this more likely result in a positive or negative 
                        outlook on your life? Would the effects of consistent negativity, 
                        not render your body more susceptible to disease? I mean, that is 
                        essentially what the evidence clearly points to. 
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-left">
                        To clarify, I’m not advocating the prohibition of news media. But 
                        I would like you to think about all the things your mind is 
                        regularly being influenced by. And be mindful/conscious of what 
                        these things could be doing to your psyche, your emotions, your 
                        spirit; and in turn, your body and its important immune system. 
                        Try to be more active in selecting predominantly positive content for your 
                        mind and trim the “fat” (the negativity) where possible. I’m also 
                        not saying that you should avoid the truth. But also do not 
                        mistake what you see/read to be absolute truth. We should all 
                        constantly and consistently be seeking truth, always be open to 
                        healthy debate and discussion and keep exposing the lies.
