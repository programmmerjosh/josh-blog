My own blog website

I took a free Bootstrap theme that looked good and customized it to my liking plus added content. This is now my blog site.

Update: I've adapted the above website into a React App (for fun and for a decent page-load speed) - although I've NOT shared the React code here in this repo. The code is a bit messy tbh. I will share in another repo once I've cleaned things up.
