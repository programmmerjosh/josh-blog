              “Write, because it forces you to think,” is something I heard from
              Dr. Jordon Peterson. It was explained in a way that made absolute
              sense to me. We live our lives, encounter different people, and
              walk away with experiences that largely make up our unique
              perspectives of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              What most of us often fail to do is document our meaningful
              experiences. And when I say document, I don’t mean send out a
              tweet, reel, live, post or comment; I mean take proper notes of
              the situation, experience and lessons learned. With these notes,
              we can look back on them, discuss them with others and formulate a
              better understanding of why things unfold the way they do or why
              some people make the decisions they make.
            </p>
            <p>
              Documenting our thoughts is of course important, but listening to
              and reading the thoughts, ideas, and experiences expressed by
              others, is twice as important. That is why we are typically born
              with two ears, two eyes, and one mouth – one tongue.

              I plan to use this space as a platform to share ideas. If there’s
              information, I consider to be relevant and important that people
              can benefit from, then I plan to share it. I in fact strongly
              believe that what I have to share, most of it not even coming from
              me but from other great minds, is very important.

              I hope you acknowledge the authors I’ve accumulated much of these
              resources from. May their reputations at least carry some weight
              in the value of this content.
