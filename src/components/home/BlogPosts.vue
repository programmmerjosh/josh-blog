                <p id="section-description">
                  I'd like to share some very powerful and revealing resources
                  I've accumulated on health and the effects of thought (and
                  emotion) on the body. Each of the sources here, you'll
                  probably find to be unpopular/undiscovered in mainstream media
                  today. Our politicians and news journalists all around the
                  world have been consistently warning us that we are in danger
                  and are under threat by a deadly virus called Covid-19. We've
                  been told to be afraid, forced to isolate (stay home),
                  distance ourselves from our friends and family members. In
                  some parts of the world (Australia, Canada), internment camps
                  have even been built as a potential “measure of containment.”
                  A hug or even a handshake from someone outside of your
                  "bubble" has (or at least for a lengthy period of time, had)
                  been considered no longer safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In many parts of the world, a face mask (or face covering of
                  any sort) was and still is, in some parts, considered
                  mandatory when inside any store or place of business. Just the
                  fact that ANY face-covering will suffice, proves that there
                  was little to zero scrutiny of any scientific data on mask
                  protection against respiratory viruses. Would you find any
                  sane virologist using a bandana for protection when dealing
                  with any kind of virus? I don’t think so. Studies have in fact
                  shown that a surgical mask (the thing most people use to
                  comply with the rules) will prohibit particles as small as 0.3
                  microns & larger; and respiratory viral particles (like the
                  flu and Covid-19) are around 0.1 micros in size. So don’t even
                  waste your time (or your fresh air) wearing one. See this
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/0tmalcJ6WRA"
                    >link to a presentation of these studies</a
                  >. But, “mask your faces” they say. “You’ll protect everyone
                  around you, just in case you have it”. This implying the
                  theory of asymptomatic transmission, which was never really a
                  thing before Covid-19 came along. And to this day, still
                  doesn’t hold up under any reliable scientific data. See this
                  <a

                    href="https://odysee.com/@drsambailey:c/Odysee-Exclusive---Covid-19-Asymptomatic-Transmission-Small-Video-:e"
                    >link to a video explaining the weak theory of asymptomatic
                    transmission</a

                <p>
                  Gyms were closed for a period of time - the place many people
                  use for exercise purposes, to combat health issues and
                  strengthen one’s immune system. Where’s the logic in shutting
                  these facilities down? A curfew had been implemented for a
                  time, and may in fact still be implemented in some parts of
                  the world. Is the virus somehow more prevalent after 10pm?
                  Someone please explain this to me. And of course lockdowns are
                  still not ruled out as a course of action. No-one has been
                  able to show that lockdowns work in terms of “flattening the
                  curve.” But they certainly have proven to increase suicide
                  rates, domestic abuse, loneliness, depression, and the list
                  goes on. Do I even need to mention the devastation of small
                  businesses or the rise in social welfare dependance?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s difficult to not go on about the horrendous measures
                  taken by our leaders, especially after how much we’ve already
                  learned about this respiratory virus. This is also not to say
                  that we don’t acknowledge that people have died. But we’re
                  talking about a very small percentage of the population here
                  (statistically). When you take into account the context of how
                  many people actually die every year (another thing rarely, if
                  ever, covered by mainstream media), Covid-19 evidently becomes
                  trivial. Full-recovery stats are impressively high but
                  unfortunately not news-worthy. Flu (respiratory virus) related
                  deaths have been happening all around the world long before
                  Covid-19 showed up and are certainly not uncommon. Quite
                  honestly, by looking at the scientific data we’ve collected
                  over the past year, if you’re not suffering from diabetes,
                  obesity, heart disease or any other moderate-to-severe
                  underlying health condition (or have a weakened immune system
                  due to old-age, for example), you really have no reason to
                  fear this thing. And if you do have one of these conditions
                  mentioned, then in your case, yes, perhaps you should be more
                  cautious. But even more than that, in my unprofessional
                  opinion, you should begin to make an effort to take better
                  care of your health by means of eating more healthily and
                  incorporating exercise into your daily lifestyle. You may want
                  to seek professional help on the subject, if necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, I’d like to share a few encouraging things with
                  you despite what's going on around the world. I'd like to
                  encourage you not to fear and not to lose hope. Do not be
                  dismayed by the message of the media and the fear headlines
                  we've been bombarded with. I have strong reason to believe
                  that this virus is not as bad as the media may portray it to
                  be. And I personally am not going to cower in fear nor treat
                  any person I come into contact with as if they're a potential
                  biohazard. I hope you join me. By reading through the
                  resources I’m about to share with you, you will begin to see
                  that the media (whether intentionally or not) are in fact
                  exacerbating this problem. I hope this message can encourage
                  you and that the resources here can help you understand that
                  fear and worry, are not healthy for you and certainly not
                  helpful in any way. Virus or not, let's not give in to fear.
                  Let's open up our minds to positivity and hopefulness so we
                  can get through this troubling/frustrating/annoying time and
                  even get through whatever else may come our way.

                          This is a well expressed perspective on the Christian
                          way to deal with worry appropriately. It may be rarely
                          practiced today and definitely not something easy to
                          do. However, most of us will agree that this rings
                          true and reassures one why we shouldn't be spending
                          any time worrying about things we largely cannot
                          control.

                          Historically, medicine in modern society has defined
                          its mission in terms of curing disease —the medical
                          disorder—while overlooking illness —the patient's
                          experience of disease. Patients, by going along with
                          this view of their problem, join a quiet conspiracy to
                          ignore how they are reacting emotionally to their
                          medical problems—or to dismiss those reactions as
                          irrelevant to the course of the problem itself. That
                          attitude is reinforced by a medical model that
                          dismisses entirely the idea that mind influences body
                          in any consequential way. Yet there is an equally
                          unproductive ideology in the other direction: the
                          notion that people can cure themselves of even the

                          are extremely scared do terribly in surgery. They

                          disease (each representative of major, broad
                          categories of disease). This order of magnitude makes
                          distressing emotions as toxic a risk factor as, say,
                          smoking or high cholesterol are for heart disease—in

                          will thus more easily fall prey to a disease. But the

                          far more extensive than this one study of studies

                          assessed how much stress people were feeling in their
                          lives, and then systematically exposed them to a cold
                          virus. Not everyone so exposed actually comes down

                          does—resist the cold virus. Cohen found that the more

                          catch cold. Among those with little stress, 27 percent

                          Like its near cousin optimism, hope has healing power.
                          People who have a great deal of hopefulness are,
                          understandably, better able to bear up under trying
                          circumstances, including medical difficulties. In a
                          study of people paralysed from spinal injuries, those
                          who had more hope were able to gain greater levels of
                          physical mobility compared to other patients with
                          similar degrees of injury, but who felt less hopeful.
                          Hope is especially telling in paralysis from spinal
                          injury, since this medical tragedy typically involves
                          a man who is paralysed in his twenties by an accident
                          and will remain so for the rest of his life. How he
                          reacts emotionally will have broad consequences for
                          the degree to which he will make the efforts that
                          might bring him greater physical and social
                          functioning. Just why an optimistic or pessimistic
                          outlook should have health consequences is open to any
                          of several explanations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          One theory proposes that pessimism leads to
                          depression, which in turn interferes with the
                          resistance of the immune system to tumors and
                          infection—an unproven speculation at present. Or it
                          may be that pessimists neglect themselves—some studies
                          have found that pessimists smoke and drink more, and
                          exercise less, than optimists, and are generally much
                          more careless about their health habits. Or it may one

                          the way medicine is practiced today; it is a blind
                          spot for medicine. Despite mounting data on the

                          well as supporting evidence for connections between
                          the brain's emotional center and the immune system,
                          many physicians remain skeptical that their patients'

                          On the other hand, there may be a business advantage
                          to humane medicine: treating emotional distress in
                          patients, early evidence suggests, can save
                          money—especially to the extent that it prevents or

                      your own mind and on your own thinking patterns? Would
                      this more likely result in a positive or negative outlook
                      on your life? Would the effects of consistent negativity,
                      not render your body more susceptible to disease? I mean,
                      that is essentially what the evidence clearly points to.

                      To clarify, I’m not advocating the prohibition of news
                      media. But I would like you to think about all the things
                      your mind is regularly being influenced by. And be
                      mindful/conscious of what these things could be doing to
                      your psyche, your emotions, your spirit; and in turn, your
                      body and its important immune system. Try to be more
                      active in selecting predominantly positive content for
                      your mind and trim the “fat” (the negativity) where
                      possible. I’m also not saying that you should avoid the
                      truth. But also do not mistake what you see/read to be
                      absolute truth. We should all constantly and consistently
                      be seeking truth, always be open to healthy debate and
                      discussion and keep exposing the lies.

                The next topic of discussion will go here. The topic is still to
                be determined as well as the collection of quality references is

              <p>
                There are a number of controversial topics I'd love to address
                and discuss such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>· Capitalism vs Marxism - Which Is The Lesser Evil?</li>
                <li>· The Utopia Idea - Why This Will Never Work</li>
                <li>
                  · Healthy Eating vs What Mainstream Media Tells Us Is Healthy
                </li>
                <li>· The Appealing Response To Hate vs The Solution</li>
                <li>
                  · Why Don't We Learn About Money In School? If We Did, Would
                  We Eliminate Poverty?
