        In the land of the sick, emotions reign supreme. Fear is a thought
        away.</strong

    <p class="d-inline">
      Historically, medicine in modern society has defined its mission in terms
      of curing disease —the medical disorder—while overlooking illness —the
      patient's experience of disease. Patients, by going along with this view
      of their problem, join a quiet conspiracy to ignore how they are reacting
      emotionally to their medical problems—or to dismiss those reactions as
      irrelevant to the course of the problem itself. That attitude is
      reinforced by a medical model that dismisses entirely the idea that mind
      influences body in any consequential way. Yet there is an equally
      unproductive ideology in the other direction: the notion that people can
      cure themselves of even the most<TheTooltip
        text="Pernicious: having a harmful effect, especially in a gradual or subtle way."
        >&nbsp;pernicious&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >disease simply by making themselves happy or thinking positive thoughts,
      or that they are somehow to blame for having gotten sick in the first
      place. The result of this attitude-will-cure-all<TheTooltip
        text="Rhetoric: the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the exploitation of figures of speech and other compositional techniques."
        >&nbsp;rhetoric&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >has been to create widespread confusion and misunderstanding about the
      extent to which illness can be affected by the mind, and, perhaps worse,
      sometimes to make people feel guilty for having a disease, as though it
      were a sign of some moral lapse or spiritual unworthiness.
      <strong> The truth lies somewhere between these extremes.</strong>

        >&nbsp;physicians&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >are still skeptical that emotions matter clinically. One reason is that
      while many studies have found stress and negative emotions to weaken the
      effectiveness of various immune cells, it is not always clear that the
      range of these changes is great enough to make a medical difference. Even
      so,
      <strong>
        an increasing number of physicians acknowledge the place of emotions in
        medicine.</strong

    <p>
      For instance, Dr. Camran Nezhat, an<TheTooltip

      ><TheTooltip

      >at Stanford University, says, "If someone scheduled for surgery tells me
      she's panicked that day and does not want to go through with it, I cancel
      the surgery." Nezhat explains, "Every surgeon knows that people who are
      extremely scared do terribly in surgery. They bleed too much, they have
      more infections and complications. They have a harder time recovering.
      It's much better if they are calm." The reason is straightforward:
      <strong>
        panic and anxiety hike blood pressure, and veins<TheTooltip
          text="Distended: swollen due to pressure from inside; bloated."
          >&nbsp;distended&nbsp;</TheTooltip

      Excess bleeding is one of the most troublesome surgical complications, one
      that can sometimes lead to death.

    <p>
      Beyond such medical<TheTooltip
        text="Anecdote: an account regarded as unreliable or hearsay."
        >&nbsp;anecdotes</TheTooltip
      >, evidence for the clinical importance of emotions has been mounting
      steadily. Perhaps the most compelling data on the medical significance of
      emotion come from a mass analysis combining results from 101 smaller
      studies into a single larger one of several thousand men and women. The
      study confirms that<TheTooltip
        text="Perturbing: causing anxiety or concern; unsettling."
        >&nbsp;perturbing&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >emotions are bad for health—to a degree. People who experienced chronic

        text="Unremitting: never relaxing or slackening; incessant."
        >&nbsp;unremitting&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >tension or incessant hostility, relentless cynicism or suspiciousness,
      were found to have <strong>double the risk of disease</strong>—including
      asthma, arthritis, headaches, peptic ulcers, and heart disease (each
      representative of major, broad categories of disease). This order of
      magnitude makes distressing emotions as toxic a risk factor as, say,
      smoking or high cholesterol are for heart disease—in other words, a major
      threat to health. To be sure, this is a broad statistical link, and by no
      means indicates that everyone who has such chronic feelings will thus more
      easily fall prey to a disease. But the evidence for a potent role for
      emotion in disease is far more extensive than this one study of studies
      indicates.

      Anxiety—the distress<TheTooltip
        text="Evoke: bring or recall (a feeling, memory, or image) to the conscious mind."
        >&nbsp;evoked&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >by life's pressures—is perhaps the emotion with the greatest weight of
      scientific evidence connecting it to the onset of sickness and course of
      recovery. When anxiety helps us prepare to deal with some danger (a
      presumed utility in evolution), then it has served us well. But in modern
      life anxiety is more often out of proportion and out of place—distress
      comes in the face of situations that we must live with or that are
      conjured by the mind, not real dangers we need to confront. Repeated bouts
      of anxiety signal high levels of stress. The woman whose constant worrying
      primes her gastrointestinal trouble is a textbook example of how anxiety
      and stress<TheTooltip
        text="Exacerbate: make (a problem, bad situation, or negative feeling) worse."

    <p class="">
      Particularly compelling evidence for the medical impact from distress has
      come from studies with infectious diseases such as colds, the flu, and
      herpes.
      <strong>
        We are continually exposed to such viruses, but ordinarily our immune
        system fights them off—except that under emotional stress those defenses
        more often fail.</strong

      In experiments in which the<TheTooltip

        text="Assay: examine (something) in order to assess its nature."
        >&nbsp;assayed&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >directly, stress and anxiety have been found to weaken it, but in most
      such results it is unclear whether the range of immune weakening is of
      clinical significance—that is, great enough to open the way to disease.
      For that reason stronger scientific links of stress and anxiety to medical
      vulnerability come from<TheTooltip
        text="Prospective: expected or expecting to be the specified thing in the future."

      heightening of distress followed by a weakening of the immune system and
      the onset of illness.

    <p>
      In one of the most scientifically compelling studies, Sheldon Cohen, a
      psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon University, working with scientists at a
      specialized colds research unit in Sheffield, England, carefully assessed
      how much stress people were feeling in their lives, and then
      systematically exposed them to a cold virus. Not everyone so exposed
      actually comes down with a cold; a robust immune system can—and constantly
      does—resist the cold virus. Cohen found that the more stress in their
      lives, the more likely people were to catch cold. Among those with little
      stress, 27 percent came down with a cold after being exposed to the virus;
      among those with the most stressful lives, 47 percent got the cold—direct
      evidence that
      <strong> stress itself weakens the immune system.</strong>
      (While this may be one of those scientific results that confirms what
      everyone has observed or suspected all along, it is considered a landmark
      finding because of its scientific<TheTooltip

      …if chronic emotional distress in its many forms is toxic, the opposite
      range of emotion can be tonic—to a degree.

      Like its near cousin optimism, hope has healing power. People who have a
      great deal of hopefulness are, understandably, better able to bear up
      under trying circumstances, including medical difficulties. In a study of
      people paralysed from spinal injuries, those who had more hope were able
      to gain greater levels of physical mobility compared to other patients
      with similar degrees of injury, but who felt less hopeful. Hope is
      especially telling in paralysis from spinal injury, since this medical
      tragedy typically involves a man who is paralysed in his twenties by an
      accident and will remain so for the rest of his life. How he reacts
      emotionally will have broad consequences for the degree to which he will
      make the efforts that might bring him greater physical and social
      functioning. Just why an optimistic or pessimistic outlook should have
      health consequences is open to any of several explanations.
    </p>

    <p>
      One theory proposes that pessimism leads to depression, which in turn
      interferes with the resistance of the immune system to tumors and
      infection—an unproven speculation at present. Or it may be that pessimists
      neglect themselves—some studies have found that pessimists smoke and drink
      more, and exercise less, than optimists, and are generally much more
      careless about their health habits. Or it may one day turn out that
      the<TheTooltip

      <strong> TOWARD A MEDICINE THAT CARES</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>
        Helping people better manage their upsetting feelings —anger, anxiety,
        depression, pessimism, and loneliness —is a form of disease
        prevention.</em
      >
      Since the data show that the toxicity of these emotions, when chronic, is
      on a par with smoking cigarettes, helping people handle them better could
      potentially have a medical payoff as great as getting heavy smokers to
      quit.

    <p>
      …emotional care is an opportunity too often lost in the way medicine is
      practiced today; it is a blind spot for medicine. Despite mounting data on
      the medical usefulness of attending to emotional needs, as well as
      supporting evidence for connections between the brain's emotional center
      and the immune system, many physicians remain skeptical that their
      patients' emotions matter clinically, dismissing the evidence for this
      as<TheTooltip text="Trivial: of little value or importance."
        >&nbsp;trivial&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >and anecdotal, as "<TheTooltip
        text="Fringe: not part of the mainstream; unconventional, peripheral, or extreme."
        >fringe</TheTooltip
      >," or, worse, as the exaggerations of a self-promoting few.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, there may be a business advantage to humane medicine:
      treating emotional distress in patients, early evidence suggests, can save
      money—especially to the extent that it prevents or delays the onset of
      sickness, or helps patients heal more quickly. In a study of elderly
      patients with hip fracture at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York
      City and at Northwestern University, patients who received therapy for
      depression in addition to normal<TheTooltip

      >care left the hospital an average of two days earlier; total savings for
      the hundred or so patients was $97,361 in medical costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the findings on emotions and health mean anything, it is that medical
      care that neglects how people feel as they battle a chronic or severe
      disease is no longer<TheTooltip
