      Old Age and the fear of Death, because it leads one closely to the border

      negative thinking and nothing but positive thought can affect a cure.
      Hypochondria, (a medical term for imaginary disease) is said to do as much
      damage on occasion, as the disease one fears might do. Most so-called
