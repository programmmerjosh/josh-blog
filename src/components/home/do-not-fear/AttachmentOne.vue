      The body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the mind,
      whether they be<TheTooltip

      the command of glad and beautiful thoughts it becomes clothed with
      youthfulness and beauty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Disease and health, like circumstances, are rooted in thought. Sickly
      thoughts will express themselves through a sickly body. Thoughts of fear
      have been known to kill a man as speedily as a bullet, and they are
      continually killing thousands of people just as surely though less
      rapidly. The people who live in fear of disease are the people who get it.

      Strong, pure, and happy thoughts build up the body in<TheTooltip
        text="Vigor: physical strength and good health."
        >&nbsp;vigor&nbsp;</TheTooltip
      >and grace. The body is a delicate and plastic instrument, which responds
      readily to the thoughts by which it is impressed, and habits of thought
      will produce their own effects, good or bad, upon it.

      Men will continue to have impure and poisoned blood so long as
      they<TheTooltip
        text="Propagate: spread and promote (an idea, theory, etc.) widely."

      body. Out of a<TheTooltip
        text="Defile: damage the purity or appearance of; mar or spoil."

        text="Manifestation: the action or fact of showing something."
        >&nbsp;manifestation</TheTooltip
      >; make the fountain pure, and all will be pure. Change of diet will not
      help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a man makes his thoughts
      pure, he no longer desires impure food.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you would perfect your body, guard your mind. If you would renew your
      body, beautify your mind. Thoughts of<TheTooltip
        text="Malice: the desire to harm someone; ill will."
        >&nbsp;malice</TheTooltip

      chance; it is made by sour thoughts.
